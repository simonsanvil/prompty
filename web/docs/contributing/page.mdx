## About Prompty
[Prompty](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) is an open-source project from Microsoft that makes it easy for developers to _create, manage, debug, and evaluate_ LLM prompts for generative AI applications. We welcome contributions from the community that can help make the technology more useful, and usable, by developers from all backgrounds. Before you get started, review this page for contributor guidelines.

## Code Of Conduct
Read the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it. The project is alse governed by the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct - [Read their FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) to learn why the CoC matters and how you can raise concerns or provide feedback.

## Providing feedback

Feedback can come in several forms:
 - Tell us about a missing feature or enhancement request
 - Let us know if you found errors or ambiguity in the documentation
 - Report bugs or inconsistent behavior seen with Prompty tools and usage

The easiest way to give us feedback is by [filing an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty/issues/new?template=Blank+issue). **Please check previously logged issues (open and closed) to make sure the topic or bug has not already been raised.** If it does exist, weigh in on that discussion thread to add any additional context of value.

## Contributor guidelines
The repository contains both the code and the documentation for the project. Each requires a different set of tools and processes to build and preview outcomes. We hope to document these soon - so check back for **contributor guidelines** that will cover the requirements in more detail.
